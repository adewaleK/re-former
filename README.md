<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project requires me to explore how forms work in Rails by first creating an HTML form then with the use of rails form helpers(form_tag and form_for). It involves creating a User model to add/update users in the database and a controller to create various actions needed to operate the form.

`User Model
`
<br /><br />
This User model consists of the Username, Email and Password fields for collecting users's records. 


`User Controller
`
<br /><br />
This controller consists of the following actions: new, create, edit and update. The new/create actions control the creation of new users while the edit/update methods control the editing/updating of existing users.
